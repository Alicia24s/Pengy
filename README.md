## Current progression

#Progress Bar:

A horizontal progress bar at the top of the page.
It has 8 checkpoints (9 if you include the one at the start).
Each checkpoint represents a step in the progress.
The progress bar visually indicates completion.

#Camera Feed (Placeholder):
A placeholder for the Raspberry Pi camera feed.
In the actual implementation, this would display the live camera feed.

#Translucent Image:
A translucent image overlaid on the camera feed.
The image changes every 5 seconds.
The opacity allows the camera feed to be partially visible underneath.

#Changeable Background:
The background of the entire page can be customized.
It remains consistent across all other elements.


Remember that this is a simplified representation. Youâ€™ll need to integrate this code with your actual camera feed and images. Additionally, adjust the layout and styling to match your design preferences.ðŸŒŸ
